<h1>The Markov chain and its Fermionic representation</h1>

<p>Here is a new representation of the Euler ensemble, leading us to the exact analytic solution below.</p>

<p>We start by replacing independent random variables \(\sigma\) with fixed sum by a Markov process, as suggested in [migdal2023exact]. 
We start with \(n\) random values of \(\sigma_i = 1\) and remaining \(N-n\) values of \(\sigma_i = -1\).
Instead of averaging over all of these values simultaneously, we follow a Markov process of picking \(\sigma_N,\dots \sigma_1\) one after another. At each step, there will be \(M = N,\dots 0\) remaining \(\sigma\). We get a transition \(n \Rightarrow n-1\) with probability \(\frac{n}{M}\) and \(n \Rightarrow n\) with complementary probability.</p>

<p>Multiplying these probabilities and summing all histories of the Markov process is equivalent to the computation of the product of the Markov matrices</p>

<div class="eqn">\[
\prod_{M=1}^{N} Q(M);
\]</div>

<div class="eqn">\[
Q(M) |n\rangle = \frac{M-n}{M} |n\rangle + \frac{n}{M}|n-1\rangle;
\]</div>

<p>This Markov process will be random until \(n=0\). After that, all remaining \(\sigma_k\) will have negative signs and be taken with probability 1, keeping \(n=0\).</p>

<p>The expectation value of some function \(\hat{X}(\{\sigma\})\) reduces to the matrix product</p>

<div class="eqn">\[
\mathbb{P}[\hat{X}] = \sum_{n=0}^{N_+} \left\langle n \right| \left(\prod_{M=1}^{N} \hat{Q}(M)\right)\cdot \hat{X} \cdot \left|N_+\right\rangle;
\]</div>

<div class="eqn">\[
\hat{Q}(M)\cdot \hat{X}|n\rangle = \frac{n}{M} \hat{X}(\sigma_{M}\to 1)|n-1\rangle + \frac{M-n}{M} \hat{X}(\sigma_{M}\to -1)|n\rangle
\]</div>

<p>Here \(N_+ = (N + \sum \sigma_l)/2 = (N + q r)/2\) is the number of positive sigmas.
The operator \(\hat{Q}(M)\) sets in \(\hat{X}|n\rangle\) the variable \(\sigma_{M}\) to \(1\) with probability \(\frac{n}{M}\) and to \(-1\) with complementary probability. The generalization of the Markov matrix \(Q(M)\) to the operator \(\hat{Q}(M)\) will be presented shortly.</p>

<p>Once the whole product is applied to \(\hat{X}\), all the sigma variables in all terms will be specified so that the result will be a number.</p>

<p>This Markov process is implemented as a computer code in [BulMig], leading to a fast simulation with \(O(N^0)\) memory requirement.</p>

<p>Now, we observe that quantum Fermi statistics can represent the Markov chain of Ising variables.
Let us construct the operator \(\hat{Q}(M)\) with Fermionic creation and annihilation operators, with occupation numbers \(\nu_k = (1 + \sigma_k)/2 = (0,1)\). These operators obey (anti)commutation relations, and they create/annihilate \(\sigma=1\) state as follows (with Kronecker delta \(\delta[n] \equiv \delta_{n,0}\)):</p>

<div class="eqn">\[
[a_i, a^\dagger_j]_+ = \delta_{i j};
\]</div>

<div class="eqn">\[
[a_i, a_j]_+ =[a^\dagger_i, a^\dagger_j]_+ =0;
\]</div>

<div class="eqn">\[
a^\dagger_n|\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_N\rangle = \delta[\sigma_n+1]|\sigma_1,\dots, \sigma_n \to 1,\dots\sigma_N\rangle;
\]</div>

<div class="eqn">\[
a_n|\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_N\rangle = \delta[\sigma_n-1]|\sigma_1,\dots, \sigma_n \to -1,\dots\sigma_N\rangle;
\]</div>

<div class="eqn">\[
\hat{\nu}_n  = a^\dagger_n a_n;
\]</div>

<div class="eqn">\[
\hat{\nu}_n|\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_N\rangle =\delta[\sigma_n-1]|\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_N\rangle 
\]</div>

<p>The number \(n(M)\) of positive sigmas \(\sum_{l=1}^M\delta[\sigma_l -1]\) coincides with the occupation number of these Fermi particles.</p>

<div class="eqn">\[
\hat n(M) = \sum_{l=1}^M \hat{\nu}_l;
\]</div>

<p>This relation leads to the representation</p>

<div class="eqn">\[
\hat{Q}(M) = \hat{\nu}_M \frac{\hat n(M)}{M}  + (1 - \hat{\nu}_M)\frac{M-\hat n(M)}{M} ;
\]</div>

<p>The variables \(\sigma_l\) can also be expressed in terms of this operator algebra by using</p>

<div class="eqn">\[
\hat\sigma_l = 2 \hat{\nu}_l -1.
\]</div>

<p>The Wilson loop can now be represented as an average over the small Euler ensemble \(\mathcal{E}(N)\) of a quantum trace expression</p>

<div class="eqn">\[
\Psi(\gamma, C)= \frac{\left\langle\hat{W}[C]\right\rangle_{\hat{\Omega} ,\mathcal{E}(N)}}{\left\langle\hat{W}[0]\right\rangle_{\hat{\Omega} ,\mathcal{E}(N)}};
\]</div>

<div class="eqn">\[
\hat{W}[C] =\text{tr}\left(\hat Z(q r)\exp{\frac{i \gamma \hat \Gamma}{\nu} } \prod_{M=1}^{N} \hat{Q}(M)\right),
\]</div>

<div class="eqn">\[
\hat \Gamma = \sum_l\Delta\vec{C}_l \cdot \hat{\Omega} \cdot  \vec{\mathcal P}_l(t);
\]</div>

<div class="eqn">\[
\hat Z(s) =\oint \frac{d \omega}{2 \pi} \exp{\imath \omega\left(\sum_l \hat\sigma_l - s\right)};
\]</div>

<div class="eqn">\[
\Delta\vec{C}_l = \vec{C}\left(\frac{l+1}{N}\right) -\vec{C}\left(\frac{l}{N}\right),
\]</div>

<div class="eqn">\[
\vec{\mathcal P}_l(t)=\sqrt{\frac{\nu}{2\left(t+t_0\right)}} \frac{\vec{\mathcal F}_l}{\gamma} , \quad \hat{\Omega} \in O(3) ,
\]</div>

<div class="eqn">\[
\vec{\mathcal F}_l=\frac{\left\{\cos \left(\hat \alpha_l\right), \sin \left(\hat\alpha_l\right), 0\right\}}{2 \sin \left(\frac{\beta}{2}\right)} ,
\]</div>

<p>\(\mathcal{E}(N)\): \(p,q,r \in \mathbb{Z}\) \(-N\leq qr\leq N\),
with \(0<p<q<N\), \(\text{gcd}(p,q) =1\),</p>

<div class="eqn">\[
\hat\alpha_{l}= \beta\sum_{k=1}^{l-1} (2 \hat{\nu}_k -1);
\]</div>

<p>The last component of the vector \(\vec{\mathcal F}_l\) is set to \(0\) as this component does not depend on \(l\) and yields zero in the sum over the loop \(\sum_l \Delta \vec{C}_l =0\).</p>

<p>The proof of equivalence to the combinatorial formula with an average over \(\sigma_l = \pm 1\) can be given using the following Lemma (obvious for a physicist).</p>

<div class="lemma">
    <strong>Lemma.</strong> The operators \(\hat{\nu}_l\) all commute with each other.
</div>

<div class="proof">
    <strong>Proof.</strong> Using commutation relations, we can write 
    <div class="eqn">\[
    \hat{\nu}_l \hat{\nu}_n = a^\dagger_l (\delta_{l n} - a^\dagger_n a_l) a_n =
    a^\dagger_l a_n \delta_{l n} - a^\dagger_l  a^\dagger_n  a_l  a_n 
    \]</div>
    
    <p>Interchanging indexes \(l, n\) in this relation, we see that the first term does not change due to Kronecker delta, and the second term does not change because \(a^\dagger_l, a^\dagger_n\) anti-commute, as well as \(a_l, a_n\), so the second term is symmetric as well.
    Therefore, \(\hat{\nu}_l \hat{\nu}_n = \hat{\nu}_n \hat{\nu}_l\)</p>
</div>
<div class="theorem">
    <strong>Theorem.</strong> The trace formula equals the expectation value of the momentum loop ansatz in the big Euler ensemble.
</div>

<div class="proof">
    <strong>Proof.</strong> As all the operators \(\hat{\nu}_l\) commute with each other, the operators \(\hat{Q}(M)\) can be applied in arbitrary order to the states \(\Sigma =|\sigma_1,\dots \sigma_N\rangle\) involved in the trace. The same is true about individual terms in the circulation in the exponential of the Wilson loop. These terms \(\vec{\mathcal F}_l\) involve the operators \(\hat \alpha_l\), which commute with each other and with each \(\hat{Q}(M)\). Thus, we can use the ordered product of the operators \(\hat G_l =\hat{Q}(l) \exp{\imath \omega \hat\sigma_l + \frac{i \gamma}{\nu} \Delta \vec{C}_l \cdot \vec{\mathcal P}_l(t)}\).

    <p>Each of the operators \(\hat G_l\) acting in turn on arbitrary state \(\Sigma\) will create two terms with \(\delta[\sigma_l\pm 1]\).
    The exponential in \(\hat G_l\) will involve \(\hat \sigma_k , k \le l\).
    As a result of the application of the operator \(\hat Z_l =\prod_{k=1}^l \hat G_k\) to the state vector \(\Sigma\) we get \(2^l\) terms with \(\Sigma\prod_{k=1}^l \delta[\sigma_k- \eta_k], \eta_k = \pm 1\). The factors \(\hat Z_l\) will involve only \(\hat \sigma_k, k \le l\), which are all reduced to \(\eta_k, k \le l\) in virtue of the product of the Kronecker deltas.</p>

    <p>Multiplying all operators \(\hat G_M\) will lead to superposition \(\hat \Pi_N\) of \(2^N\) terms, each with product \(\prod_{M=1}^N \delta[\sigma_M-\eta_M]\) with various choices of the signs \(\eta_i=\pm 1\) for each \(i\).
    Furthermore, the product of Kronecker deltas will project the total sum of \(2^N\) combinations of the states \(\Sigma\) in the trace \(\text{tr}{\dots}\) to a single term corresponding to a particular history \(\eta_1,\dots\eta_N\) of the Markov process.</p>

    <p>The product of Kronecker deltas in each history will be multiplied by the same state vector \(\Sigma\), by the product of Markov transition probabilities, and by the exponential \(\exp{ \frac{i \gamma}{\nu} \sum_l\Delta \vec{C}_l \cdot \hat{\Omega} \cdot \vec{P}_l(t)}\) with the operators \(\hat \sigma\) in \(\vec{\mathcal P}_k(t)\) replaced by numbers \(\eta\) leading to the usual numeric \(\vec{P}_l(t)\).
    The transition probabilities of the Markov process are designed to reproduce combinatorial probabilities of random sigmas, adding up to one after summation over histories [Norris_2007].
    The integration over \(\omega\) will produce \(\delta\left[\sum_l \hat\eta_l - s\right]\).
    This delta function will reduce the trace to the required sum over all histories of the Markov process with a fixed \(\sum_l \eta_l\).</p>
</div>

<p>We have found a third vertex of the triangle of equivalent theories: the decaying turbulence in three-dimensional space, the fractal curve in complex space, and Fermi particles on a ring. 
By degrees of freedom, this is a one-dimensional Fermi-gas in the statistical limit \(N \to \infty\). However, there is no local Hamiltonian in this quantum partition function, just a trace of certain products of operators in Fock space. So, an algebraic (or quantum statistical) problem remains to find the continuum limit of this theory of the Fermion ring.</p>
