    <h1>Loop functional and its general properties</h1>
    <p>The loop functional is defined as a phase factor associated with velocity circulation, averaged over the initial distribution $\vec{v}_0$ of the velocity field</p>
    
    <div class="math-display">
    \[
    \begin{aligned}
    \Psi(\gamma, C) &= \VEV{\exp{\frac{\I \gamma}{\nu}\Gamma }}_{\vec{v}_0} \\
    \Gamma &= \oint_C \vec{v}(\vec{r}) \cdot d \vec{r}
    \end{aligned}
    \]
    </div>

    <p>We use viscosity $\nu$ as a unit of circulation. Both have the same dimension $L^2/T$ as the Planck's constant $\hbar$. The viscosity will play the same role in our theory as Planck's constant in quantum mechanics. The variable $\gamma$ with this definition is dimensionless.</p>

    <p>This loop functional is the Fourier transform of the PDF for the circulation over fixed loop $C$</p>

    <div class="math-display">
    \[
    \begin{aligned}
    \Psi(\gamma, C) &= \int_{-\8}^\8 d \Gamma P(\Gamma, C) \exp{ \frac{\I \gamma}{\nu} \Gamma } \\
    P(\Gamma, C) &= \int_{-\8}^\8 \frac{d \gamma}{2 \pi\nu} \Psi(\gamma, C) \exp{ -\frac{\I \gamma}{\nu}\Gamma }
    \end{aligned}
    \]
    </div>

    <p>There is an implicit dependence of time, coming from the evolution of the velocity field by the $\NS$ equation</p>

    <div class="math-display">
    \[
    \begin{aligned}
    \partial_t \vec{v} &= -\nu \nabla \times \vec{\omega} - \vec{v}\times \vec{\omega} - \vec{\nabla} \left( p + \frac{\vec{v}^2}{2} \right) \\
    \nabla \cdot \vec{v} &= 0 \\
    \vec{\omega} &= \vec{\nabla} \times \vec{v}
    \end{aligned}
    \]
    </div>

    <p>We restrict ourselves to three-dimensional Euclidean space, the most interesting case for physics applications. The generalization to arbitrary dimension is straightforward, as discussed in previous papers [1,2,3].</p>

    <p>In the next sections, we shall study the Cauchy problem for the loop equation [1,2], which follows from the $\NS$ equation. Here, we state some general properties of the loop function and various scenarios of its evolution.</p>

    <p>[Figure: Asymptotic trajectories of the time evolution for the loop functional inside the unit circle in the complex plane. The laminar flow is the yellow region on the circle close to $\Psi =1$. Three other flows are 1) hypothetical explosion, 2) decaying turbulence, and 3) special fixed point.]</p>

    <p>The first obvious property is that this evolution goes inside the unit circle</p>

    <div class="math-display">
    \[
    \abs{\Psi(\gamma, C)} \le 1 \;\; \forall t
    \]
    </div>

    <p>At a small enough time passed from initial data, $t < t_c$, turning off the noise would bring us to the usual unique laminar solution of the $\NS$ equation, corresponding to the loop functional at the unit circle with a small enough phase.</p>

    <div class="math-display">
    \[
    \lim_{\sigma\to 0}\abs{\Psi(\gamma, C)} = 1 \;\; \forall t < t_c
    \]
    </div>

    <p>Here, $\sigma$ denotes the variance of the Gaussian distribution of the velocity field around some smooth initial value. Generally speaking, we could expect the following fixed points (see Figure) of the time evolution for the loop functional<sup>1</sup>.</p>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Special solution</strong>. There is a fixed point corresponding to the global random rotation of the fluid (see [1,2,3]).</li>
        <li><strong>Decaying Turbulence</strong>. The evolution of loop average reaches some <strong>fixed trajectory</strong>, independent of initial data, and covers some nontrivial manifold (see [3,4]). At infinite time, this fixed trajectory leads to zero velocity, corresponding to all the kinetic energy dissipated by viscous effects.</li>
        <li><strong>Finite-time explosion?</strong> The vorticity could blow up at some finite or infinite point in time, leading to infinite circulation. In this case, the loop functional would cover the unit circle at this moment of singularity.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>In the following sections, we elaborate on each of these possible regimes. The finite-time explosion is proven to be inconsistent and is therefore ruled out.</p>

    <div class="footnote">
        <sup>1</sup>We do not count deterministic fixed points corresponding to potential flows. They correspond to isolated points on the unit circle.

    <h1>Loop equation</h1>
    <p>The first step is to write down the loop equation by projecting the Hopf equation to the loop space.</p>

    <p>Before doing that, we have to specify certain boundary conditions which we assume in our fluid dynamics. Namely, we consider infinite space $\mathbb{R}_3$, with boundary condition of vanishing or constant velocity at infinity.</p>

    <p>Vorticity can exist throughout the entire spatial domain, but it vanishes at infinity, as required by our boundary conditions, where velocity gradients diminish. We also assume the absence of internal boundaries, such as solid surfaces that the fluid flows around. However, we allow for the presence of singular regions of vorticity, such as vortex lines and sheets, in the inviscid limit, provided these regions are confined to a finite portion of the volume, consistent with our boundary conditions.</p>

    <p>At finite viscosity, these singular regions acquire a finite thickness proportional to $\sqrt{\nu}$, leading to anomalous dissipation in turbulent flows.</p>

    <p>An alternative, simpler mechanism for anomalous dissipation arises when velocity increases as viscosity vanishes, even in the absence of singular vortex structures like Burgers vortices. In this scenario, the turbulent energy grows as viscosity decreases, while the spatial distribution of vorticity remains homogeneous and non-singular.</p>

    <p>As we will demonstrate below, this is the mechanism realized in our solution for decaying turbulence.</p>

    <p>The computations leading to the loop equation were performed in the old papers. For the reader's convenience, we repeat them here using another language, hopefully more clear for mathematicians.</p>

    <div class="math-display">
    \[
    \begin{aligned}
    \partial_t \Psi(\gamma,\vec{C}) &= \VEV{\frac{\I \gamma}{\nu}\oint d \vec{C}(\theta) \cdot \vec{L}(\vec{C}(\theta))\exp{\frac{\I \gamma}{\nu}\Gamma(\vec{v}, \vec{C})}}_{sol} \\
    \vec{L}(\vec{r}) &= -\nu \vec{\nabla} \times \vec{\omega}(\vec{r}) + \vec{\omega}(\vec{r})\times\vec{v}(\vec{r})
    \end{aligned}
    \]
    </div>

    <p>The averaging $\VEV{}_{sol}$ goes, as before, over time-dependent $\NS$ solutions $\vec{v}(\vec{r})$ with a given set of initial values $\vec{v}_0(\vec{r})$. It is implied that a probability measure is supplied for this set of initial velocity fields. The phase factor of circulation is averaged over initial data using this measure.</p>

    <p>The gradient terms $\vec{\nabla}(p + \frac{\vec{v}^2}{2})$ dropped in the time derivative of the circulation as the integral of a gradient of some single-valued function of coordinate $H(\vec{r}) = p(\vec{r}) + \frac{\vec{v}^2(\vec{r})}{2}$ around the closed loop:</p>

    <div class="math-display">
    \[
    \oint d\vec{C}(\theta) \cdot \vec{\nabla}H(\vec{C}(\theta)) = \oint dH(\vec{C}(\theta)) = 0
    \]
    </div>

    <p>The velocity field $\vec{v}$ is a solution of the Poisson equation, relating it to vorticity by incompressibility condition:</p>

    <div class="math-display">
    \[
    \vec{v}(\vec{r}) = \frac{-1}{\vec{\nabla}^2}\vec{\nabla}\times \vec{\omega}(\vec{r})
    \]

    <h1>The definitions of the loop operators and the proof of the loop equation</h1>

    <p>The operators in the loop equation were introduced previously and explained at length in review papers. In this paper, we do not assume any knowledge of the previous work; instead, we derive the loop operators from scratch using a simpler method.</p>

    <p>First, we approximate the smooth loop $C(\theta)$ by a polygon with $N$ vertices $\vec{C}_k = \vec{C}(2\pi k/N)$ in the limit $N \to \infty$. We postpone this local limit until we solve the discrete loop equation. This limit will define the continuum theory in the same way as in the QFT; the functional integral is discretized using a lattice with the lattice spacing going to zero at the end of the calculation. In this limit, the theory's parameters vary with the lattice spacing to provide a finite result for the physical observables.</p>

    <p>The first observation is that with smooth velocity and vorticity fields, the discrete circulation around the polygon $\vec{C}_k, k = 0,\dots N-1, \vec{C}_N = \vec{C}_0$ converges to the circulation around the smooth loop:</p>

    <div class="math-display">
    \[
    \begin{aligned}
    \Gamma &\equiv \sum_k \Delta C_k \cdot \vec{v}(\vec{C}_k) \to \oint d\vec{C}(\theta) \cdot \vec{v}(\vec{C}(\theta)) \\
    \Delta C_k &= \vec{C}_{k+1} - \vec{C}_k
    \end{aligned}
    \]
    </div>

    <p class="bold">In the rest of the paper, we shall use the language of the continuum theory, implying the limit $N\to \infty$ of a polygon $\vec{C}$ with $N$ sides. While the lengths of the sides of $\vec{C}$ vanish in the local limit $N \to \infty$, the sides of $\vec{P}$ polygon are not at our disposal, so they may stay finite (this will happen in the decaying turbulence below).</p>

    <h1>Schr√∂dinger equation in loop space</h1>

    <p>Before we investigate the solutions of the loop equation, let us consider its physical and mathematical meaning and its relation to the geometry of the incompressible flow.</p>

    <p>By definition, the loop functional $\Psi(\gamma,\vec{C})$ is a superposition of the phase factors $\exp{\frac{\I\gamma}{\nu}\Gamma(\vec{v}, \vec{C})}$ with the circulation $\Gamma$ of a particular solution $\vec{v}(\vec{r}, t)$ of the $\NS$ equation. These solutions have initial values $\vec{v}(\vec{r}, 0) = \vec{v}_0(\vec{r})$, distributed by some distribution $P[\vec{v}]$ which we assume Gaussian with the mean given by some smooth initial field and some coordinate-independent variance $\sigma$.</p>

    <p>In the turbulent scenario, the $\NS$ trajectories initiated from a narrow vicinity of some smooth velocity field eventually expand and cover some attractor, slowly varying with time and asymptotically converging to $\vec{v} = 0, \Psi = 1$.</p>

    <p>The alternative smooth solution of the $\NS$ equation, sought after in numerous mathematical papers, would correspond to these trajectories staying close and converging to a single trajectory in the limit $\sigma \to 0$. This single trajectory would go along the unit circle, bounding our disk.</p>

    <p>With this generalization of a definition of the Cauchy problem for the $\NS$ equation, we can address the existence of smooth, explosive, or stochastic (i.e., turbulent) solutions within the loop equation's framework.</p>

    <p>The transformation from the $\NS$ equation to the loop equation is similar to that from the Newton equation of the particle in random media to the diffusion equation. We add dimension to the problem, switching to the probability distribution in $\mathbb{R}_d$, after which the particle's infinitesimal time steps translate into probability derivatives by coordinates.</p>

    <p>There are two essential differences, however. Our loop space is not just higher-dimensional; in the local limit $N \to \infty$, it is infinite-dimensional. The second difference is that in addition to diffusion terms $\nu \hat{\nabla} \times \hat{\omega}$, we have nonlocal advection terms $\hat{v} \times \hat{\omega}$ affecting the evolution of the distribution in loop space.</p>

    <p>Our definition of the loop functional already by construction has superficial similarities with quantum mechanics. We are summing phase factor over a manifold of solutions of the $\NS$ equations. The circulation plays the role of classical Action, and viscosity plays the role of Planck's constant.</p>

    <p>This analogy becomes a complete equivalence when the time derivative of the loop functional is represented as an operator $\vec{L}(\vec{C}(\theta)) \Rightarrow \hat{L}(\theta)$ in the loop space acting on this functional.</p>

    <p>Now we have quantum mechanics in loop space, with the Hamiltonian:</p>

    \[
    \hat{H} \propto \oint d\vec{C}(\theta) \cdot \hat{L}(\theta)
