This solution\nfamily is equivalent to a fractal curve in complex space\nC\nd\nwith random steps parametrized by\nN\nIsing\nvariables\ns\ni\n=\n\u0006\n1\n, in addition to a rational number\np\nq\nand an integer winding number\nr\n, related by\n\u00e5\ns\ni\n=\nq r\n. This equivalence provides a dual theory describing a strong turbulent phase of the Navier-\nStokes \u0003ow in\nR\nd\nspace as a random geometry in a different space, like ADS\/CFT correspondence\nin gauge theory. From a mathematical point of view, this theory implements a stochastic solution\nof the unforced Navier-Stokes equations. For a theoretical physicist, this is a quantum statistical\nsystem with integer-valued parameters, satisfying some number theory constraints. Its long-range\ninteraction leads to critical phenomena when its size\nN\n!\n\u00a5\nor its chemical potential\nm\n!\n0\n. The\nsystem with \u0002xed\nN\nhas different asymptotics at odd and even\nN\n!\n\u00a5\n, but the limit\nm\n!\n0\nis well\nde\u0002ned. The energy dissipation rate is analytically calculated as a function of\nm\nusing methods of\nnumber theory. It grows as\nn\n\/\nm\n2\nin the continuum limit\nm\n!\n0, leading to anomalous dissipation at\nm\n\u00b5\np\nn\n!\n0\n. The same method is used to compute all the local vorticity distribution, which has no\ncontinuum limit but is renormalizable "

Introduction\nWe derived a functional equation for the so-called loop average or Wilson loop in\nturbulence a while ago. All the references to our previous works can be found in a recent\nreview paper [\n1\n].\nThe path to an exact solution by a dimensional reduction in this equation was proposed\nin the 1993 paper but has just been explored. At the time, we could not compare a theory\nwith anything but crude measurements in physical and numerical experiments at modest\nReynolds numbers. All these experiments agreed with the K41 scaling, so the exotic\nequation based on unjusti\u0002ed methods of quantum \u0002eld theory was premature. The\nspeci\u0002c prediction of the Loop equation, namely the Area law, could not be veri\u0002ed in DNS\nat the time with existing computer power.\n1.1. Fluctuating geometry in gauge theory and turbulent \u0003ow\nThe situation has changed over the last decades. No alternative microscopic theory\nbased on the Navier-Stokes equation emerged, but our und erstanding of the strong turbu-\nlence phenomena grew signi\u0002cantly. On the other hand, the loop equations technology in\nthe gauge theory also advanced over the last decades. The correspondence between the\nloop space functionals and the original vector \u0002elds was better understood, and various so-\nlutions to the gauge loop equations were found. In particular, the momentum loop equation\nwas developed, similar to our momentum loop used below [\n2\n,\n3\n]"

The loop\n\n2 of 42\ndynamics was extended to quantum gravity, where it was used to study nonperturbative\nphenomena [\n6\n,\n7\n].\nAll these old and new developments made loop equations a major nonperturbative\napproach to gauge \u0002eld theory. So, it is time to revive the hibernating theory of the loop\nequations in turbulence, where these equations are much simpler. The latest DNS [\n8\n\u0152\n11\n]\nwith Reynolds numbers of tens of thousands revealed and quanti\u0002ed violations of the K41\nscaling laws. These numerical experiments are in agreement with so-called multifractal\nscaling laws [\n12\n].\nTheoretically, we studied the loop equation in the con\u0002nement region (large circulation\nover large loop\nC\n) and justi\u0002ed the Area law suggested in '93 on heuristic arguments.
