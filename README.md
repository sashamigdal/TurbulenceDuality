# **AI-Powered Interactive Assistant for Turbulence Research**

Welcome to the **Turbulence Duality Open Project**, where we aim to revolutionize turbulence research by providing tools and insights into decaying turbulence using the Euler ensemble and string theory duality. This project includes a specialized **AI-powered assistant** designed to enhance user interaction by dynamically answering queries about turbulence formulas, computations, and visualizations.

---

## **Overview**

The AI assistant will:
- Parse natural language queries (e.g., "What is the energy spectrum of decaying turbulence?").
- Retrieve relevant Mathematica formulas and computational results from notebooks and PDFs.
- Execute computations and generate plots dynamically using Wolfram Language APIs.
- Provide explanations and visualizations to make complex concepts accessible.

This assistant combines **natural language understanding (NLU)** with **Mathematica integration**, empowering researchers to interact directly with the data and theory.

## **Technical Roadmap**

### **1. Define Core Components**
- **Natural Language Understanding (NLU):**  
  Use an AI model (e.g., OpenAIâ€™s GPT-4 or Hugging Face transformers) fine-tuned on turbulence-related queries.
- **Integration with Mathematica:**  
  Execute Mathematica commands using Wolfram Cloud APIs or WolframScript for real-time computations.
- **Document Parsing:**  
  Extract formulas and context from PDFs using libraries like `PyPDF2` or Wolfram Language's text parsing tools.
- **Interactive Interface:**  
  Provide a web-based or GitHub-hosted chatbot for user interaction.
