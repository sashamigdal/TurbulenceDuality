# **AI-Powered Interactive Assistant for Turbulence Research**

Welcome to the **Turbulence Duality Open Project**, where we aim to revolutionize turbulence research by providing tools and insights into decaying turbulence using the Euler ensemble and string theory duality. This project includes a specialized **AI-powered assistant** designed to enhance user interaction by dynamically answering queries about turbulence formulas, computations, and visualizations.

---

## **Overview**

The AI assistant will:
- Parse natural language queries (e.g., "What is the energy spectrum of decaying turbulence?").
- Retrieve relevant Mathematica formulas and computational results from notebooks and PDFs.
- Execute computations and generate plots dynamically using Wolfram Language APIs.
- Provide explanations and visualizations to make complex concepts accessible.
- Actively monitor new publications to identify opportunities for collaboration.

This assistant combines **natural language understanding (NLU)** with **Mathematica integration**, empowering researchers to interact directly with the data and theory.
